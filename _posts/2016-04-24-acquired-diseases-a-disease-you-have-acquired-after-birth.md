**Acquired** diseases - A disease you have acquired after birth, that is not congenital. Could include most of them, from infections to organ dysfunction such as heart failure or kidney failure. Genetics may still playa role in most things, at least in susceptibility to the disease.

**Inflammatory** diseases - Inflammation can arise without infection, but may often follow on from some infection - eg rheumatic heart disease following rheumatic fever. These are different from rheumatoid arthritis, as "rheum" generally means joints, like hip or knee, or fingers etc - as in a rheumatologist who specialises in these diseases. Many inflammatory diseases are of this type:

**Autoimmune** diseases - Where the body (immune system) attacks itself. Many have been described, including some thought to have other mechanisms in the past. Over 80 diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosis ( SLE or "lupus"), type one diabetes (attacks insulin producing cells in the pancreas), multiple sclerosis (MS), myesthenia gravis, Grave's disease or thyrotoxic goitre (enlarged thyroid with excess thyroxine production which is hypERthyroidism), AND Hashimoto's thyroiditis which causes hypOthyroidism , or lack of thyroid hormone(s) production). Also Guillian-Barr√© syndrome, which is back in the news as a probable complication following Zika virus infection. Many types of vasculitis such as polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), and giant cell arteritis often called temporal arteritis, are not uncommon. For a list of these see [here:][0]
