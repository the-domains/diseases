So many nasty **diseases** out there ... Should you really _worry_?

Maybe yes, but not too much! Worry causes stress, which makes some diseases worse. But you often hear that prevention is better than cure.

And much of modern healthcare or medicine is based on prevention, screening, and expensive drugs to stop diseases from developing or progressing - hopefully! Too much perhaps, the worried well is turning many of into hypochondriacs.

TYPES OF DISEASE

**Congenital** diseases - Bad luck if you have been born with a serious disease like cystic fibrosis or osteogensis imperfecta. But prospective parents may be able to screen their future offspring and have a child without the disease. But some choose not to, and it costs money.

There are hundreds though, and some only show up later in life not at birth or before (in utero). These are not really congenital, but

**Hereditary **diseases - As above, its in your genes inherited from your parents. Might now show up for years, eg Huntington's disease, Friedrich's ataxia, and many more. Many diseases have some hereditary component, making you susceptible to it perhaps? The genetic vs environmental debate will go on for decades for most diseases, but knowing more people's genome will help understanding the contributions for many of them. Its not just genetics, but epigenetics and proteomics now, complication matters somewhat but faster computers and better scientific communication and collaboration will gradually allow huge advances.

**Infectious** diseases - We all get some of these, at least a cold, but less and less. Infections killed half the population before they got to 5 years old, before the modern era. Vaccinations, public health, attention to hygiene, antiseptics, modern surgery and anesthesia/anaesthetics, and of course antibiotics (and antivirals, plus anti-parisite drugs) have almost removed infection as a common cause of death. "Developing" countries are rapidly catching up to the developed world in this regard too, with life expectancy almost equalising everywhere. Great news, and mostly due to vaccination in fact. People still die from sepsis (often unrecognised early enough), bacterial meningitis, viruses like HIV, hepatitis C (or B still), dengue, and influenza. Not to mention ebola, zika and all the newsworthy ones that frighten people the most. It is unfortunate when preventable deaths occur from refusing to be vaccinated, more commonly as ignorance provokes fear, often promoted through websites, online forums and groups. Malaria is still a big cause of premature death in tropical countries, alomg with others like schistosomiasis (bilharzia) which is carried by water snails. Many other parasitic infestations can cause disabilities but usually easily treatable - eg hookworm, filariasis, or hydatids.
